/* Operators in Js: 
 - It is the same for every programming language the operators is no new concept in JavaScript.
 There are two types of operators Arithematic and Assignment Operators.

 1.Arithematic Operators : 
 -> These are operator's which are used while dealing with Airthematic Calculations.
 Examples:
  Addition : +
  Substraction : -
  Division : /
  Multiplication : * 
  Exponential : **
  Modulus : % 
  ++a -> Increment the value before  
 Incrementation: a++
 Decrementation: a--

2.Assignment operators :
-> These are called Assignment operators they are used while we need to Assign the value with in different condition.

Examples:
a += 5 (a= a+5)
a *= 6 (a= a*6)
a /= 6 (a= a/6)
a**=2 ( a = a**2)

 3.Comparision Operators
-> While we are implent a boolean condition we need Comparision operators.

Attributes:
== (Equal's to)
!= (Not equals to)
=== ( Important: Equal Value and data Type)
!== (Important: not Equal value or not Equal data type)
> (less than)
< (greater then)
>= (less than equal to)
<=(greater than equal to)
?  (turnary operator)

4.Logical Operators
-> These operators come in handy while we use conditional statement's and want to deal with some arguments.

Attributes:

&& ->  AND 
/ -> OR
! -> NOT
